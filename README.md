## DES Encryption Algorithm

This Python code is an implementation of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for encryption.

1. `binary_to_hex`: This function converts a binary string to a hexadecimal string.
2. `keyGeneration`: This function generates 16 round keys from the initial key. It uses the `keyp`, `shift_table`, and `key_comp` arrays for permutation and shifting operations.
3. `xor`: This function performs a bitwise XOR operation on two binary strings.
4. `bin2dec`: This function converts a binary number to a decimal number.
5. `dec2bin`: This function converts a decimal number to a binary number.
6. `encrypt`: This function performs the DES encryption. It uses the `initial_perm`, `exp_d`, `per`, `sbox`, and `final_perm` arrays for various permutation, expansion, substitution, and final permutation operations. It also uses the round keys generated by the `keyGeneration` function.
7. `plaintext` and `key` are defined, and the `keyGeneration` function is called to generate the round keys. These round keys are then converted to hexadecimal format and stored in the `rk` list.
8. Finally, the `encrypt` function is called to encrypt the plaintext using the round keys.

The output of the program is the encrypted ciphertext and round keys in hexadecimal format.
